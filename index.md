_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify risks](projects/report.md)**_

This project explored the relationship between sentiment measures derived from 10-K filings and firm returns around the 10-K release. I constructed a dataset by merging sentiment data from financial filings with return data for frims in the S&P 500 in 2022. I explored the mechanical construction of sentiment variables, considering both lexicon-based sentiment measures and topic-specific contextual sentiment measures, focusing on revenue, risk, and growth.

## Career Objectives

I am pursuing a career in finance, with a focus in ivestment research, asset management, or financial anlysis. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in both traditional finance and data-driven decision-making. I'm especially interested in working with teams that value critical thinking, long-term strategy, and client-focused solutions. Through internships, coursework, and personal projects, I aim to deepen my understanding financial markets, portfolio construction, and financial modeling.

## Hobbies

In my free time, enjoy playing golf, poker, and cooking. Poker appeals to me for its emphasis on risk assessment and decision-making under uncertainty. Cooking is a creative outlet that I find both relaxing and rewarding. I'm also an avid support of Liverpool F.C.
